## SSH Info Yo

### Allow root access.
`I know it's bad...I really don't care`

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

## Install SSH Client

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### Edit Config File

Edit config file here:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Comment out the following line:
`PermitRootLogin without-password`

Just below it, add the following line:
`PermitRootLogin yes`

Restart SSH

```bash
service ssh restart
```

> These instructions may be old, so it's possible you'll have to use `systemctl` instead of `service`.  Just a thought
