## Install

Use Balena Etcher to flash device.  Can use anything, including USB stick, as long as you can boot into it from BIOS.  No need to decompress/extract the install .img.gz file.  Just write that img.gz file right to the media via Etcher!

### Default Credentials

UN: root
 P: linux

### Save game states
* This directory holds the states

`/userdata/saves`

This is an example directory housing the dolphin emulator save states (ie: Mario Party and Mario Kart for GameCube)

```terminal
/userdata/saves/dolphin-emu/GC/USA/Card A
```
