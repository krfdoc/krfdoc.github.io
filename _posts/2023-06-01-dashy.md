### Using Docker Compose

Using Docker Compose can be useful for saving your specific config in files, without having to type out a long run command each time. Save compose config as a YAML file, and then run `docker compose up -d` (optionally use the `-f` flag to specify file location, if it isn't located at `./docker-compose.yml`), `-d` is detached mode (not running in the foreground of your terminal). Compose is also useful if you are using clusters, as the format is very similar to stack files, used with Docker Swarm.

The following is a complete example of a [docker-compose yml](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) for Dashy. Run it as is, or uncomment the additional options you need.

```terminal
---
version: "3.8"
services:
  dashy:
    # To build from source, replace 'image: lissy93/dashy' with 'build: .'
    # build: .
    image: lissy93/dashy
    container_name: Dashy
    # Pass in your config file below, by specifying the path on your host machine
    # volumes:
      # - /root/my-config.yml:/app/public/conf.yml
    ports:
      - 4000:80
    # Set any environmental variables
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    # Specify your user ID and group ID. You can find this by running `id -u` and `id -g`
    #  - UID=1000
    #  - GID=1000
    # Specify restart policy
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Configure healthchecks
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'node', '/app/services/healthcheck']
      interval: 1m30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

You can use a different tag, by for example setting `image: lissy93/dashy:arm64v8`, or pull from GHCR instead by setting `image: ghcr.io/lissy93/dashy`.

If you are building from source, and would like to use one of the [other Dockerfiles](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/docker), then under `services.dashy` first set `context: .`, then specify the the path to the dockerfile, e.g. `dockerfile: ./docker/Dockerfile-arm32v7`

### Please note

* Havent studied the locally mapped passthru volume yet.  May want to modify the compose file to assign a special local file on Wharf.  Maybe save a config yml file to KRFdoc too
